# Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python notebook for data analysis using statistical and machine learning methods.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to install the required libraries. Use the following command to install the libraries:

```
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

## Usage

Open the notebook and run each cell in order. In this notebook, the data analysis is performed in the following steps:

1. Importing the necessary libraries:
   - pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
   - matplotlib: for plotting graphs and plots.
   - seaborn: for advanced data visualization and plotting aesthetically pleasing plots.
   - plotly: for interactive graphing and plotting.

2. Reading the CSV file containing the data:
   - The desired file should be named "cleaned_data.csv" and located in the same directory as the notebook.

3. Displaying a few initial rows of the data:
   - To examine the structure and content of the data.

4. Providing information about the data:
   - Analyzing the data features and examining distributions, means, variances, etc.

5. Using statistical methods:
   - Employing regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and probability distributions to investigate relationships and interpret the data.

6. Applying machine learning methods:
   - Utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks for pattern recognition and uncovering hidden relationships in the data.
